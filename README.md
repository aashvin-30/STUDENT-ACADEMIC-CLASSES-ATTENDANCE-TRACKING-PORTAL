# STUDENT-ACADEMIC-CLASSES-ATTENDANCE-TRACKING-PORTAL
The Student Academic Classes Attendance Tracking Portal is a smart system designed to automatically record attendance of students using face recognition technology. Instead of manual attendance, the system captures a studentâ€™s face, matches it against a pre-trained dataset, and marks attendance automatically in a database or file.
